# PROJECT_TITLE: üìù NOTE API

This is a simple API Project I built with Django REST Framework (DRF) for managing personal notes.  
Each user can sign up, log in,logout and manage their own notes (create, read, update, and delete).  
It also keeps track of notes when each note was created and updated automatically.
